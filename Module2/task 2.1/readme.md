1. What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?
	- Citrix XenServer;
	- Microsoft Hyper-V; 
	- Red Hat KVM;
	- VMware vSphere;

2. Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.
Features Citrix XenServer:
	Site recovery
	Host crash protection
	Multi-server management
	Dynamic memory management
	Role-based administration and control
	Distributed virtual switch controller
	In-memory read caching
	Live VM migration and XenMotion storage
Features Hyper-V:
	Support for persistent memory.
	Hyper-V is less demanding on hardware.
	Shielded VM updates.
	Simple two-node clusters.
	Storage Spaces Direct improvements.
	Windows Admin Center.
	Encrypted subnets.
Features Red Hat KVM:
	Container support
	Scalability
	Overloading resources
	Disk I / O Adjustment
	Hot plugging virtual resources
	Inexpensive virtualization solution
	The most resource-friendly software. This should be considered when designing budget virtualization solutions.
	Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Programming and API
	Live migration and storage migration
	Integration with Red Hat Satellite
	Disaster recovery support
Features VMware vSphere:
	vCenter Server: A centralized management tool used to configure, provision and manage virtualized IT environments.
	vSphere SDK: Provides third-party interfaces for accessing vSphere.
	VM file system: The cluster file system for VMs.
	Virtual SMP: Allows one virtual machine to use multiple physical processors at the same time.
	vMotion: Provides live migration with transaction integrity.
	Storage vMotion: Allows you to transfer virtual machine files from one location to another without disrupting service.
	High Availability: If one server fails, the virtual machine switches to another server with spare capacity to ensure business continuity.
	Distributed Resource Scheduler: Automatically assigns and distributes computations across hardware resources available to virtual machines.
	Fault Tolerance: Creates a copy of the primary virtual machine for continuous availability.
